<b>Whether you want to move around the city in a cab, order private car rides or send your things from one area of the city to the other, Cabify is your transportation and mobility app. </b> And without giving up the most important thing: the safety and quality of your trips.

<h2>Cabify, the safe transportation option for your trips. Reach your destination in a premium cab or private car.</h2>

<b>How does Cabify work?</b>

1. Reserve or request your car or taxi ride. Indicate in the app where you are located. Select your destination, as well as the type of transportation you want to use: Cabify, cab or delivery.

2. Confirm your request to order a trip and that's it! We will provide you with the details of the car or taxi and the driver, either for a trip or for a delivery.

3. Always know the estimated price before traveling. We will tell you how much you will pay for your car or cab ride. In addition, you can select the payment method that best suits you: debit card, credit card or cash.

4. Share your journey. Send the details of your trip to family and friends so that they know where you are at all times and make you feel even safer.

In addition, you will always move with maximum safety measures. All users - drivers and passengers - must travel with face masks, the cars and cabs are cleaned and ventilated frequently and have a divider panel.
