<b>Find what to watch next</b>
Browse 700,000+ movies and TV episodes from across your streaming apps, all in one place and organized into topics and genres. Discover new things with recommendations based on what you love and what’s trending across the services you already have access to. Search for titles to see which streaming apps offer them.

<b>See the latest releases</b>
Buy or rent the newest movies and shows right in the Shop tab. Purchases are stored in your Library and can be downloaded to watch when you're not connected. Watch instantly on your laptop, Android phone or tablet, or on your TV with Google TV or on Play Movies & TV where available. 

<b>One list for all your discoveries</b>
Add interesting shows and movies to your Watchlist to keep track of your new discoveries and view them later. The Watchlist is shared between all your devices, so you can even add to your Watchlist from your TV or phone and laptop through Search on any browser.

<b>Use your phone as your remote </b>
With a remote built right into the app, you can find something great to watch even when the couch has eaten your remote. And you can use your phone’s keyboard to quickly type complicated passwords, movie names or search terms on your Google TV or other Android TV OS device.
